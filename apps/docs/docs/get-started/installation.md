# Installation

Scholarsome can be installed one of two ways for production uses: via Docker Compose, or Docker.

For individuals contributing to the development of Scholarsome, it is possible to directly run it outside a container. However, this method is only recommended for development uses.

This documentation is written assuming that the system Scholarsome is being installed on is **Linux-based.** Scholarsome is compatible with other platforms, but you will have to source your own installation instructions for non-Linux systems.

:::caution Environment Files
For each installation method, there is a separate environment file. Ensure that the one downloaded matches your method of installation.
:::

## Via Docker Compose

:::tip Recommended
This is the recommended method of installation, as it is does not require any external database connections.
:::

Make a directory for the necessary files.

```
mkdir ~/scholarsome && cd ~/scholarsome
```

Download the compose file.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hwgilbert16/scholarsome/develop/compose.yml
```

Download the environment file and make a copy of it.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hwgilbert16/scholarsome/develop/.env.compose.example && cp .env.compose.example .env
```

Open `.env` with your favorite text editor, and fill in the required fields, along with any optional ones that fit your use case.

:::info
If the SMTP fields are left blank, users will be verified by default. Most installations do not need email verification.

Start the container in a detached state. Replace `(port)` with the value you selected for `HTTP_PORT` in the environment file.

:::warning
You must set `STORAGE_LOCAL_DIR` to `/data` if you are planning to use the example command below.
:::

```
mkdir ~/scholarsome-media && docker run -d --env-file .env -p (port):(port) -v ~/scholarsome-media:/data --restart=always --name scholarsome hwgilbert16/scholarsome
```

To stop the container, run:

```
docker stop scholarsome
```

## Outside a container

Reference the [development guide](../development/development-guide.md) for steps on how to run Scholarsome outside a container.
