# Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is research-proven learning technique that involves reviewing material at varying intervals. Newer and more difficult cards are shown more frequently, while cards that are easier to recall are shown less frequently. There's no designated end goal - the reviews of each card just get more and more spread out over time.

[SM-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo#Description_of_SM-2_algorithm) is the spaced repetition algorithm that is used.

## Starting spaced repetition learning

Any set in Scholarsome can be studied using spaced repetition - including ones you haven't made yourself. As long as you have an account and can access a public set, you can learn using spaced repetition.

Before starting, it is critical that your timezone is set to your correct one. To do this, click on your user at the top right of any page, and click settings. At the top, there is a section called "Change timezone." Use the dropdown to indicate your timezone, and then click the purple button named "Change timezone." If you created an account in version v1.3.0 or later, your timezone should be automatically set. Either way, you should check that it is accurate before proceeding.

After your timezone is set, navigate to the set you'd like to study within Scholarsome and click on the "Spaced Repetition" button at the top of the page. A window will open. In this window, you'll need to input the number of cards that you would like to study each day for this set. This can be any positive number, but the recommendation is anywhere from 20-30, depending on the size of your set, and the amount of time you'd like to spend each day studying.

Once you've input this number, click the purple "Start" button. Spaced repetition learning has now started for your designated set.

## Using spaced repetition

After starting, there will be a new section in the set titled as "Spaced Repetition." In this section, you can view the number of today's completed cards, the number of cards due today, and the total number of cards you have not yet studied in this set.

To start the study session for the day, click the purple button labeled as "Start today's study session." You'll be greeted with a familiar interface, one that is very similar to normal flashcards. 

After flipping a card, you'll be able to select from four buttons: bad, tricky, better, and easy. These are for you to indicate how well you remembered the card. "Bad" indicates you were entirely unable to recall the card, and "easy" indicates you had no trouble remembering the information. "Bad" and "tricky" indicate that the recall was incorrect, while "better" and "easy" indicate the recall was correct. The number below each button indicates when the card will next be due if you select the button. Your response will be used in the algorithm to determine when your next review for this card will be due.

Every time you review a card, you'll be tracked using three metrics: the amount of time it takes you to recall the card, the quality (which button you select after flipping the card), and whether the recall was correct or not. In a future update, you'll be able to get insights into this data using graphs and other visual aids.

Continue reviewing cards until you reach the limit for the amount of cards you have set per day. For optimal studying, you should come back every day to see what is available and/or due for you to study. If you miss a due date for a card, the algorithm will take this into account when deciding the next due date.

## Spaced repetition keyboard controls

- Spacebar or the number zero (0) to flip the card.
- The number one (1) corresponds to "bad"
- The number one (2) corresponds to "tricky"
- The number one (3) corresponds to "better"
- The number one (4) corresponds to "easy"
